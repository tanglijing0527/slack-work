Slack API in Go

## Why?
I am currently learning Go and this seemed like a good idea.

## Stability
As with any other piece of software expect bugs. Also, the design isn't finalized yet because I am not happy with how I laid out some things. Especially the websocket stuff. It is functional but very incomplete and buggy.

## Help
Anyone is welcome to contribute. Either open a PR or create an issue.
